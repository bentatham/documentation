# Plugins

Plugins help to extend the features of gauge. They are available at various defined scopes. The different types of plugins that can be used with gauge are below.

#### Language Plugins
 Also known as **language runners**, these are plugins that provide the support for execution of specs for the particular programming language. Example - [Java](../test_code/java.md), [Ruby](../test_code/java.md).

#### Execution Scope plugin
These are plugins that work during the execution of the specifications.
Example - [HTML Report Plugin](html_report_plugin)

#### Setup based plugin
These are plugins that act on a setup phase - When the plugin added to the project. As the name suggests, they do plugin specific setup on the project.



##Default plugins

Some plugins are installed by default with gauge and are added to every new created project.
